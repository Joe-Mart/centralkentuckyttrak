                    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Central Kentucky T-Trak group is not a formal group.  It consists of people in the 
                        Louisville, Kentucky area who model N Scale T-Trak.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes, we get together at people's houses to run on the modules.  But most of the time,
                        we go to shows with some or all of our modules to hang out with the public and to promote
                        N Scale in general and T-Trak in particular.
                    </p>
    
                    <h1>Membership Requirements</h1>
                    <p>
                        Since we are not a formal club, we do not charge membership fees.  
                        All we request you do is to make a T-Trak module and hopefully be able 
                        to attend shows.  That plus be nice to people and respect other members'
                        properties.
                    </p>
                    <h1>What Is T-Trak</h1>
                    <p>
                        <a target="_"blank" href="http://www.nrail.org">T-Trak</a> is an international module standard
                        started in Japan and adapted to the United States/Rest of The World in 2000.
                    </p>
                    <p>The modules are simple to build with wood or other products, are easy to carry, and easy to set up
                        since they are designed to be on table tops.
                    </p>

                    <h1>What T-Trak Can Do For You?</h1>
                    <p>Okay, I have to cheat here.  Taking inspiration from President Kennedy's Inauguration Speech, I 
                        want to say "Ask not what T-Trak can do for you, ask what you can do for T-Trak"
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are some things I believe can be done using T-Trak module specifications, especially in N Scale:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lightweight yet sturdy modules that don't get heavier over time.</li>
                        <li>Great for teaching newcomers, especially children, into model railroading.</li>
                        <li>A great way to experiment with track and or scenery.</li>
                        <li>In most NMRA groups, the T-Trak modules qualify for diorama contests if they are part of their
                            monthly contest and/or show and tell sessions.</li>
                        <li>Along with the NMRA dioramas, the modules could be judged for the Achievement Program classes as well.
                            I would check with your AP Director first, though.
                        </li>
                        <li>Being designed for table tops, you can fit a layout in any configuration, even on your dining room table, 
                            if that is allowed!
                        </li>
                    </ul>

Code Louisville Project for class.  Group Model Railroad T Trak in the Louisville, Kentucky, area.

Project to meet the requirements of the Code Louisville Front End Web Development Course.
Upon completion of the project, I plan to upload the site to production with some changes.

Items currently created to meet the minimum requirements:

1.  Media Queries.  Media queries have been adjusted for the mobile first design and are working properly. The 
                    tablet media query and laptop/desktop work fine.  These adjust the flexboxes in the css.
2.  CSS Features:   Used flexbox for the navigation bar and the header logos.  
                    a. On a mobile screen, the group logo and T-Trak logo stack on top of each other.  
                    b. In the Navbar, the links stack on top of each other too.  
3.  JavaScript:     Contact form that validates the existence of information.  Upon completion, the user
                      goes to the "thanks.html" page.

Code Louisville Project for class.  Group Model Railroad T Trak in the Louisville, Kentucky, area.

Project to meet the requirements of the Code Louisville Front End Web Development Course.
Upon completion of the project, I plan to upload the site to production with some changes.

Items currently created and/or working to meet the minimum requirements:

1.  Media Queries.  Two media queries originally set up to work reverse of the mobile first recommendation.  Current issue now is transferring the styles for the current media query to the main page, and moving the laptop/desktop sizes to the renamed media query for larger sizes.  The second media query is for medium size for tablets.  They work fine.  As of now, only the color and size of the text, and making pictures smaller are the only items that are being done.  Was planning on using the hamburger menu for the smaller size.  Having issues with that.  
2.  CSS Features:  a. Using flexbox to adjust the sizes and text of the menu bar if the hamburger button does not work. 
                        Want to at least change the navigation items from one row to two rows when the size decreases.
                   b. Create the hamburger button to show on mobile and tablet devices.
                   c. If the hamburger button does not work, consider creating a media player in the tornadomod.html file.
3.  JavaScript:    a. Contact form that validates the existence of information.  Still need to work on storing that 
                      information locally.  The Contact form will not be used if I publish the site.  Updated the process
                      to make sure email address is in the proper format.

Current issues have been mentioned, but to recap:

1. Correct media queries to mobile first.
2. Hamburger button.
3. Navbar changes.
4. Storing Contact information.
5. Implementing media player.

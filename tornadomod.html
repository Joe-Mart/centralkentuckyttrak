            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The tornado module I have now is actually the second instance of such a module.
            </p>
            <p>
                Credit for both tornado modules I have belongs to Gerry LaPlace, a member of the Radcliff
                Model Railroad Association of Radcliff, KY.
            </p>
            <p>>
               He was inspired to do a module after he and I saw the N Trak version at the NMRA National Train Show
               in Cincinnati, Ohio, back in 2005.  This one was created by an N Trak member from St. Louis, Missouri.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I introduced N Scale T-Trak to the NMRA back in 2007, Gerry saw an opportunity to try to make a similar
                module, but obviously smaller.  He could not get the tornado to move up and down like on the N Trak module,
                but he did find an electronic module that simulated the thunder sound and came with a flashing light to 
                indicate lightning strikes.
            </p>
            <p>Since I was doing more shows than Gerry, I purchased it and started touring around with it at shows, and it 
                became a huge hit,
            </p>
            <p>In 2018, for almost 11 years, the tornado module could not be maintained.  So, I commissioned Gerry to make 
                another one.  Hence, Tornado Module 2.0 was created and debuted at Trainfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
                and is alive and well today.</p>
